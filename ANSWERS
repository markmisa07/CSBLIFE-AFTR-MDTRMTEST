1 have you ever failed an exam? what were the reasons for failing?
  -yes, the reason is because sometimes i lack the time to study. sometimes i cram(although cramming usually result in a failing- 50% grade).another reason is discipline because i lack the discipline to allot a time for studying, i usually waste my time playing games.

3)how was your CSB midterm examination knowing what you know now, what would have you done differently? what are you going to do again for the finals? 
 -i had been very busy because i had to study very hard so that i will pass my exams. i would have done nothing different because i know that i din my best in the present.I think i will just keep on studying hard and balancing my time between gaming and studying

2)why didn't i answer number 2?
 - it is because i still haven't experience an "all pass" exam. i sometimes fail an exam as well.
